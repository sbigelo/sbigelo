### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sean Bigelow and I am a Fullstack Software Engineer. After spending over a decade in beverage sales, I decided to plunge headfirst into the world of tech.  I was inspired to make the change because of the satisfaction I get from solving a problem and knew this was the perfect path.


I just graduated from Flatiron Software Engineering (10/18/21) where I learned HTML/CSS, Javascript, JSON, Nokogiri, Rails, React, Redux, Ruby, Sinatra, and SQL.
I'm currently working on various code challenges and more into challenging React/Redux projects.
I'm currently trying to expand my knowledge with grasping the basics of Python.
